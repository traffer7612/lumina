/**
 * @title  CeitnotInvariantHandler
 * @notice Stateful fuzzing handler for CeitnotEngine invariant tests.
 *         Each public function is a possible state-machine action that
 *         Foundry's invariant runner randomly selects and calls.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - Three pre-funded actors interact with a single market (ID = 0).
 *   - Each action calls `_advance()` first to move to a new block, satisfying
 *     the engine's `noSameBlock` guard for per-(user, market) positions.
 *   - `fail_on_revert = false` in foundry.toml so the framework silently
 *     ignores operations that correctly revert (e.g. borrow > LTV).
 *   - Ghost counters let the invariant contract assert the handler was exercised.
